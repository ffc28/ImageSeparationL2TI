This is the note (wiki) for the internship of Xhenis

Fangchen: 1. I send the convention de stage, some useful links and some documents to Xhenis to start the internship asap. 
	  2. I want to creat a place where we can exchange files, codes and figures. If Gitlab.paris13 is not avaible, then Github is a good tool
	  3. We can start with the document restauration in which some research work are going on. Two things important: a) the mixing model, pay attention to the fact that the pixels are positive. b) Independent Assumption: I don't kown if the image sources recto verso are independent or not
	  4. We can begin with a "Fake" mixing model (mixing of one block of images without mean value) to test the independent assumption
	  5. Then we'll do something with the mixing model. Maybe this problem is easy
	  6. Why are the two source components correlated? A decomposition into a specific dictionary can reduce the indendency? This can also include the learning process for Xhenis
	  7. For the desmoking problem, the first idea is to put it into the frame of multichannel separation: several blocks or several frames of video with hypothesis that the smoking is varing slowly.
